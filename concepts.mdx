title: Understanding Biodiversity Footprint
description: Core concepts behind biodiversity assessment and reduction, including key metrics and strategies supported by Darwin Data.
---

## Overview

Darwin Data empowers you to assess and reduce your organization's biodiversity footprint through a modular platform. This page explains the core concepts, from defining your biodiversity impact to designing effective nature strategies using advanced technologies.

## Defining Biodiversity Footprint

Your biodiversity footprint measures the impact of business activities on ecosystems, species, and genetic diversity. Unlike carbon footprints, it accounts for habitat loss, species extinction risks, and ecosystem service degradation.

<Callout kind="info">
  Biodiversity footprint integrates quantitative metrics like species richness and qualitative factors like ecosystem resilience.
</Callout>

Darwin Data calculates this holistically, helping you identify high-impact areas in your supply chain.

## Key Environmental Metrics

Darwin Data tracks essential metrics to quantify biodiversity impact. Use these to benchmark and prioritize actions.

| Metric | Description | Scale | Darwin Data Support |
|--------|-------------|-------|---------------------|
| MSA | Habitat degradation percentage | 0-100% | Automated calculation from land-use data |
| RLI | Extinction risk trend | -1 to 1 | Integration with IUCN data |
| Condition Score | Service functionality | 0-100 | Custom weighting models |

## Nature Strategy Design Principles
